I left L.A today
I'm on another plane
I spent too much time
on the dark side of your door
I spent the night awake
Had all that I could take
I might not see
those baby blue eyes anymore
Come on
I'm shining like a diamond
in the dark
I'm floating like a lion
in the ark
I'm walking round in circles
through the park
And no tough talk will erase you
Now I know how many holes
it takes, too
And I really don't know
how to shake these memories
There's a fire in the sky
And baby there's red dawn
in my eyes
And all the meanings got
so twisted since you've gone
And I guess I'll hope you fine
But really you know I hope
you're crying
And there's a million things
to say since you been gone
Come on
I'm shining like a diamond
in the dark
I'm floating like a lion
in the ark
I'm walking round in circles
through the park
And no tough talk will erase you
Now I know how many holes
it takes, too
And I really don't know
how to shake these memories
Desperate eyes
Don't recognize
the warning signs
Alibis
They won't keep you warm
at night
Come on
I'm shining like a diamond
in the dark
I'm floating like a lion
in the ark
I'm walking round in circles
through the park
And no tough talk will erase you
Now I know how many holes
it takes, too
And I really don't know
how to shake these memories
Now I know how many holes
it takes to
And I really don't know
how to shake these memories
